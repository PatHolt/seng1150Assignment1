          <h3 id="generated" >Warning - HTML, XML, CSS Generating Tools</h3>

          <p>
            You are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to use tools which
            <em>generate</em> HTML, XML, XSLT or CSS code, either from a visual
            representation or otherwise. This includes DreamWeaver,
            Microsoft Frontpage, saving to HTML from MS Word, etc.
            You must write all code yourself in a <strong><u>plain-text</u></strong>
            editor such as Notepad++.
            Any assignments that use code generated from a tool will be given
            <strong>ZERO</strong>.

        <p>
The board of directors for an long-running Australian video rental franchise wish to establish a website to remain competitive in an increasingly online entertainment market. Called <em>Rewind Rentals</em>, the business as well as customers can list their home entertainment products for short term rentals under a wide range of categories, such as movies, games, speakers, consoles, screens, and more.</p>

<p> With this in mind, the board has invited you, as a promising student of the University of Newcastle with web communication skills, to develop their web site, <em>Rewind Rentals</em>. They would like you to construct a prototype of the web page to be launched. In particular they would like you to choose TWO of the product categories as listed above and, for each, provide a page listing THREE products for rent. That means that, if you choose movies as a category, your page should list THREE movies for rent.</p>
<p>
Note: You can make up your own categories, say for example VR headsets, TV Shows, holographic projectors, e-books, etc. Also, these need not be real products - feel free to make up your own.</p>
		
		
		<p>
			Your task is to present these products as appealingly as possible on the web. 
	  This will involve, </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Creating an <a href="#template">XML template</a> and <a href="#dtd">DTD</a> </li>
          <li>Creating two <a href="#objects">XML documents</a></li>
          <li>Developing <a href="#web">several web pages</a> for the site.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Details of all these requirements are given below.
        </p>

        <hr />

		<h2 id="template">XML template</h2>
        <p>
			The template will be a <strong>valid</strong> XML file. The important parts here are the tags
			(the organization of the data), <strong>not the actual data</strong> about any product. 
			However, you may need to include some arbitrary data to allow your page to be validated. 
			For example, if the <em>default</em> of an attribute is #REQUIRED, 
			the attribute needs a value otherwise it will not be validated.
		</p>

        <h3> XML Specification</h3>
        <p>
As the entertainment industry develops and changes around the globe new advances in technology may give rise to new categories of products. For example, further advances in the 'metaverse' are expected to eventually lead to the creation of fully immersive entertainment media. So Jim's IT team, responsible for page updating and maintenance, will need an XML template that they can copy and use for all new categories (i.e. do not hardcode allowed categories into the template). The template will be used for your example products as described below.</p>
      <p>
		The document should be able to store as many products as required within a given category. 
			
			You will decide the tags that you wish to use to describe the products, 
			but, for each product, you should at least have element tags for the following items â€¦. 
	</p> 
		
	<ul>
		<li>Name (only one)</li>
		<li>Description (only one)</li>
		<li>Rental cost</li>
		<li>Search tags (zero or more)</li>
		<li>Parental Rating (zero or one)</li>
		<li>Product condition (zero or one)</li>
		<li>Extras (at least one)
			<ul>
				<li>Name</li>
				<li>Additional cost (or included with product)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Reviews (zero or more)</li>
		<li>The filename of a picture of the product (one or more, use a relative path)</li>
		<li>URL of a webpage related to the product (use an absolute path)</li>
	</ul>        
	<p>
			The 'Name' tag should have an attribute that indicates the mode of delivery (physical or digital). If you include only the items mentioned above you will 
			<strong>NOT</strong> get full marks for the assignment. Please add at least 3 more meaningful tags that make your template different from others. At least one other tag (aside from the 'name' tag) should also have an attribute.
		</p>
		
        <hr />

        <h2 id="dtd">DTD</h2>

        <p>
          You will also need to write a DTD for your XML. Generally, it is your choice whether the DTD 
		  is internal or external, however, for this assignment, you should make 
		  the DTD internal because it is easier to validate your XML and DTD. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Your DTD will need to describe all the tags and attributes that you used in your XML. 
		  It will also be important to use optional modifiers (+, *, ?) to indicate how many 
		  instances of each tag are allowed. 
        </p>
		<p>
			In your DTD, define at least two entities (&lt;!ENTITY&gt;) and use them in the XML document.
		</p>


        <hr>
		<h2 id="objects">XML documents</h2>

        <p>
          Once you have your XML template with DTD, you will need to make 2 separate XML documents.
        </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Choose two categories and</li>
			<li> Write one XML document for each category.</li>
			<li> Each XML document should contain <strong>data</strong> for 3 products.</li>
			<li> Each XML document should contain the internal DTD at the top of the document.</li>
			<li> The DTDs in 2 XML documents must be the same.</li>
			<li> The 2 XML documents <strong>MUST</strong> have the same tags and DTD as the XML template.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<hr />
		
	<h2 id="web">Page development</h2>
		<p>
		You will develop web pages for the <em>Rewind Rentals</em> website. You need to create the following files:<br>
		</p>
		
		<ul>
		<li><a href="#all">Homepage (index.html)</a></li>
		<li><a href="#all">About Us (about.html)</a> - Use a template such as from <a href="https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/best-about-us-pages">https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/best-about-us-pages</a></li>
		<li><a href="#all">Contact  (contact.html)</a> - Follow examples at <a href="https://www.ventureharbour.com/15-contact-form-examples-help-design-ultimate-contact-page/">https://www.ventureharbour.com/15-contact-form-examples-help-design-ultimate-contact-page/</a>. Include options for mail and telephone - as well as a contact form for sending messages.</li>
		<li><a href="#all">Privacy Policy (privacy.html)</a> - This is necessary as you are collecting data including personal identifying information (PII) from your guests. When creating this, you may use a template such as that at <a href="https://www.visser.com.au/blog/generic-privacy-policy-for-australian-websites/">https://www.visser.com.au/blog/generic-privacy-policy-for-australian-websites/</a></li>
		<li><a href="#all">Terms and Conditions (terms.html)</a> - Use template at <a href="https://termly.io/resources/templates/terms-and-conditions-template/">https://termly.io/resources/templates/terms-and-conditions-template/</a> and customise for your own site</li>
		<li><a href="#css">Cascading Style Sheet (style.css)</a></li>
		</ul>
		
		and your site map should look as below.<br />

		</ul>
		
		<h3 id="form">Contact Form</h3>
		<p>The contact page (<code>contact.html</code>) should allow visitors to send messages to Rewind Rentals. This will be done as a HTML form, which sends the information using a POST request to https://jkorpela.fi/cgi-bin/echo.cgi when they click the "Submit" button. The following things need to be included on the form:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>An appropriate level 2 heading</li>

		</ul>
						
		<h3 id="css">External Style Sheet</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> Once your webpages are written, create an external style sheet (<code>style.css</code>) to define a consistent style for each page. The external style sheet should specify:
			<ul>
				<li>The style of a header tag</li>
				<li>The background image, and the font family, size, and colour for the text</li>
				<li>The style of the tags you used</li>
			</ul></li>

			<li>Use at least one ID and one class selector in CSS. </li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Coding Style</h3>
		<p>
		  Please note that your HTML code, XML code, and CSS code <strong>must</strong> be neat, indented, clear, and commented. Comments are at the top of the file, 
			stating the name of the file, the name of the author and the date the file was created. Make sure these are comments, 
		  i.e. they donâ€™t show on the web page, but only when one looks at the source code. An indentation and a clean, organized code is also helpful for you as the designer. </p>
		<p>Other than the specifications mentioned, the way you design your page is up to you. However it should use semantically-correct tags. </p><p>
		Your creation should be fully valid HTML and CSS.</p><p>
		<strong>All code must be your own work. The use of external libraries (such as bootstrap) is not permitted.</strong>
		</p>

		<h3 id="research">SENG6051 only - Research Task</h3>
		<p>Consider the following thesis statement:</p>
		<p><em>The use of HTTP/1.0 by web servers is more secure than HTTP/2 because, for example, it is harder for attackers to sustain a denial of service attack without the ability to abuse persistent connections.</em></p>

        <h2 id="submit">Submission</h2>

        <p>
          Your submission should contain a template file (containing XML and DTD), and the 2 XML files (each XML file contains an internal DTD), html homepage and a CSS file. If there
          are any other files that are part of your assignment (e.g. graphics files), include those too. You should also 
		  include a <span class="file">README.txt</span> file,
          containing your student number, a list of the files that are part
          of your submission, and references to any external content (such as images) that you have taken from other sources.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, your submission should include a completed
          Assignment Cover Sheet. You can download an Assessment Item Cover 
          Sheet for Individual Assessment from Canvas
          or from <a href="http://www.newcastle.edu.au/current-students/learning/assessments-and-exams/submitting-an-assessment">
         SUBMITTING AN ASSESSMENT</a>,
          then fill in the details and include it with your submission.
          An Assignment Cover Sheet submitted electronically is deemed to
          have been signed.
          Your assignment cannot be marked until a completed cover sheet
          is received.

         <p>
            Plagiarism is defined as
            <dfn>presenting the work of others' as if it was your own</dfn>.
            This includes the copying of content from other people's
            Web pages (and other sources) without "appropriate referencing"
            (indicating the parts of your assignment which have been
            copied and where they were copied from).
          </p>

          <p>
            If you "quote" other people's work (or images) in your assignments, then
            you <strong>must</strong> reference them appropriately (use a README.txt file to do this).
            Failure to do so will cause you to lose marks for the assignment.
            An assignment that consists largely of work copied from elsewhere
            will receive very low (zero) marks, and may be reported to the
            School for suspicion of plagiarism.
